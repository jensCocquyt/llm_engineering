       "The code snippet you provided is a Python expression that uses a generator with a set comprehension. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}`**: This part is a set comprehension that creates a set of unique authors from the `books` collection. \n",
       "   - `book.get(\"author\")` fetches the value associated with the key `\"author\"` from each `book` dictionary.\n",
       "   - The `if book.get(\"author\")` condition filters out any books that do not have an author (i.e., it only includes those with a non-null author).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **`yield from ...`**: The `yield from` statement is used in a generator function to yield all values from another iterable. In this case, it yields each of the authors extracted from the set comprehension.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example\n",
       "\n",
       "Let’s say you have a list of books like this:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book A\", \"author\": \"Author X\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book B\", \"author\": \"Author Y\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book C\", \"author\": None},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book D\", \"author\": \"Author X\"},\n",
       "]\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "When the code runs:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` will create a set: `{\"Author X\", \"Author Y\"}`. \n",
       "  - Note: \"Author X\" appears twice but will only be included once because sets do not allow duplicates.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `yield from` will then yield these authors one at a time, allowing them to be iterated in a loop once this generator is consumed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why It’s Useful\n",
       "\n",
       "Using a set comprehension combined with `yield from` is useful for generating a unique list of authors dynamically while also allowing you to yield values in a memory-efficient manner, especially if you want to handle large datasets or streams of information.\n",
       "\n",
       "For further reading, you can refer to the official Python documentation on [generators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generator-iterator) and [set comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#set-comprehensions)."

       "This code defines a function `ask` that sends a question to a chatbot model and streams the response back in real-time. Let's break it down:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Function Parameters**:\n",
       "   - `question`: The question you want to ask the model.\n",
       "   - `client`: An instance of the client used to interact with the model's API.\n",
       "   - `model`: The specific model you are using (like GPT-3, etc.).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **API Call**:\n",
       "   - `client.chat.completions.create(...)`: This line creates a chat completion request to the model. \n",
       "   - The `model` specifies which language model to use, and `messages` contains the conversation context:\n",
       "     - The `system` message likely defines the behavior or persona of the assistant.\n",
       "     - The `user` message contains the actual question being posed.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Streaming**:\n",
       "   - `stream=True` enables the function to receive responses in chunks, which is useful for generating responses while still typing or processing.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Updating Display**:\n",
       "   - `display_handle = display(Markdown(\"\"), display_id=True)`: This initializes a display area to show the response as it is being streamed.\n",
       "   - In the loop, for each `chunk` received from the stream:\n",
       "     - `response += chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ''`: This updates the cumulative response with the content of the current chunk.\n",
       "     - `update_display(Markdown(response), display_id=display_handle.display_id)`: This updates the displayed response in real time.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Return**:\n",
       "   - The final line returns the complete response after streaming is finished.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example Usage\n",
       "If you have a `client` instance and you want to ask a question to a model:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "response = ask(\"What is the capital of France?\", client, \"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n",
       "print(response)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Documentation References\n",
